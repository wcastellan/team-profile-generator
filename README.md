  ## Description:
  This application was created to generate a team profile based on user input using the Inquirer module from Node.js and display the information in a newly created HTML page with its own styling.  The project demonstrates the use of OOP and TDD using Jest.

  ## Installation:
  The user should clone the repository and make sure that Node is installed on their device.  This application also requires a file system and the Inquirer module.  If they are going to test anything, they should also install jest.

  ## Usage:
  Use 'node app.js' and answer the prompted questions.  You can view a walk through video here - [Screencastify]()
